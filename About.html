            <p class="paragraph-about">Atomic was founded in the Austrian Alps in 1955, by Alois Rohrmoser. The first 40 pairs of skis were hand-carved in his workshop using locally sourced wood.

Within two years production grew to over 2000 pairs of skis. Atomic’s current headquarters is located 5 kilometers from where the brand was born.

Success at elite level competitions has always fueled and defined our brand. From the World Cup racing circuit to the X games, the Freeride World Tour to the Vasaloppet, countless skiers past and present have all won with Atomic. Validation at the top of the sport is a crucial part of the brand’s research and development and drives innovation across all skiing disciplines.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-about">From the piste to the powder, distant backcountry peaks to local Nordic tracks, Atomic exists to drive skiing forward.
Founded in 1955, Atomic makes the world’s finest winter sports equipment. For over 65 years, our products have helped redefine the skiing experience for skiers of all levels, from beginners taking their first turns to the greatest athletes pushing their boundaries at the very top of the sport.

            <p class="paragraph-about">It is clear why a skiing brand would care deeply about its impact on the environment. Of all the outdoor industries affected by the climate crisis, Winter Sports are under the most immediate threat.

Given its role as a leading manufacturer, Atomic has a deep understanding of its supply chain and recognizes the associated impact of every material and step used in the manufacturing process. To better understand how the brand can reduce its impact, Atomic spent 2021 doing detailed research into all aspects of the environmental impact of the business. This work has been underpinned by the rigorous technical approach Atomic brings to every subject. The full audit will be published in 2022.

Moving forward Atomic is taking bold action to transform the supply chain, to innovate for sustainable performance, and to collaborate for mass action across the ski community. As Atomic evolves, we will continue to be a purposeful driving force, relying on science and data to redefine what innovation, sustainability, and performance mean to skiing.</p>
